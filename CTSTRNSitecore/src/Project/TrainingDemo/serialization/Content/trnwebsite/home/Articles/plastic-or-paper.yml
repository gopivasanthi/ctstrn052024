        The backlash against single-use plastics has seen a growing market for paper, metal, glass and plant-based straws. But is the choice between them really a simple one?<br />
        Y<br />
        You've probably had this problem: you order a smoothie to sip with your lunch, a morning iced coffee or your Friday night cocktail, and it arrives with a brightly-coloured tube of paper sticking out the top. After a few slugs, however, the tube quickly flops in on itself, forcing you to take it out and leave it on the table in a wet, pulpy mess.<br />
        <br />
        Paper straws have become almost ubiquitous in bars and fast-food outlets as the hospitality industry has rushed to ditch plastic in response to a consumer backlash. But while they may not linger in the environment for 300 years or so like those made of plastic, paper straws leave a lot to be desired.<br />
        <br />
        A recent study has also highlighted another potential concern. Paper straws assessed by researchers at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, were found to contain more "forever chemicals" &ndash; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS &ndash; than plastic. These long-lasting PFAS can stay in the environment for decades, can contaminate water supplies, and are associated with a range of health problems. (Read more about where forever chemicals come from, how long they last for and how we could clean them up.)<br />

        The researchers behind the study say their results suggest that paper straws &ndash; along with their bamboo counterparts, which were also found to contain PFAS &ndash; are not necessarily a more sustainable alternative to plastic. The higher levels of forever chemicals they contain, they say, could be seen as a question mark over how "biodegradable" these alternatives are.<br />
        <br />
        As someone who began embracing alternatives to plastic straws nearly a decade ago, it left me wanting to find out more. I also wanted to know about other factors that need to be taken into account, such as the climate emissions produced from these different straw types.<br />
        <br />
        One not very scientific, but much repeated estimate, put the number of disposable drinking straws used every day in the US at 500 million. The validity of that statistic has been disputed, and the real figure could be less than half that amount. Certainly, the amount being spent on&nbsp; disposable drinking straws has been rising year on year for the past two decades. And although the estimates for exactly how straws are used each year and how many end up in the environment are tricky to confirm, what's clear is that plastic straws get everywhere. They are found in huge numbers in beach clean-ups around the world. They have been found perforating the stomachs of penguins, and even jammed inside the nostril of an Olive Ridley sea turtle.<br />
        <br />
        An infamous, horrifying video of this last case particularly stuck in my mind. I'm a huge animal lover, so was quick to urge my friends to opt for plastic alternatives instead. Most plastic waste experts I've spoken with consider this video a major catalyst for the anti-plastic straw movement.<br />
        <br />
        Milo Cress also deserves some credit &ndash; he uncovered that 500 million straws a day statistic ad started the Be Straw Free movement in 2011 when he was only nine. The campaign eventually inspired major companies such as Starbucks and McDonalds to stop using plastic straws and entire states like California to ban them outright.<br />
        <br />
        While that may sound like a huge boon for sustainability, as I took a closer look at the environmental impact of plastic straws, I was surprised to learn that it's a drop in the bucket compared to other plastic pollution.<br />

        When you walk on a beach, plastic straws are one of the most common types of litter you'll see &ndash; one recent survey along a beach on India's Gujarat coast on the Arabian Sea found they made up 9% of the litter there. But they actually make up only a tiny fraction of the plastic waste that finds its way into the environment.
